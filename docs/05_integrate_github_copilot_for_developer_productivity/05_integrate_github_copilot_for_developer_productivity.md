# Exercise 05: Integrate GitHub Copilot for developer productivity

## Scenario

Zava is dedicated to leveraging AI not only for devops automation and security practices, but also to help with efficient delivery of new features. In this training you will be using Copilot to generate issues for code updates and features, and to implement those updates and features. There will be trade-off between productivity improvements using AI, and what it would take to do the work yourself. 

In this exercise, you will first review how the solution was upgraded from .NET 6 to .NET 8 (LTS) - a reference implementation that demonstrates how Copilot can be used to create issues and implement upgrades. You will then use Copilot to create a Chatbot feature that will use the Phi-4 model to ask questions about products and pricing. This model will at first not be based on Zava data since this solution is not yet connected to a database.

## Objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll be able to:

- Review the .NET 8 upgrade implementation (reference example)
- Understand how GitHub issues describe update requirements  
- Use Copilot chat to begin implementing a Chatbot feature for the solution

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 45 minutes
